  The [`docker_stats` receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver)
  queries the local Docker daemon's container stats API for all desired running containers on a configured interval.
  These stats are for container resource usage of cpu, memory, network, and the blkio controller.
