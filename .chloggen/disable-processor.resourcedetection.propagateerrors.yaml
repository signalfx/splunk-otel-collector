  In upstream release v0.142.0, the `processor.resourcedetection.propagateerrors` feature gate has been changed from disabled to enabled by default. 
  This change may lead to unexpected crashes in environments where resource detection errors occur. 
  To mitigate this issue, we have disabled the `propagateerrors` setting by default in our distribution. 
  Users who require strict error propagation can manually enable this feature in their configuration.
