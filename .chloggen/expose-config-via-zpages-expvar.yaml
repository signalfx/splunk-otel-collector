  The endpoint exposed by the `zpages` extension is now configured expose the collector configurations
  (initial and effective) via the `expvarz` endpoint, e.g.: http://localhost:55679/debug/expvarz
  for the default `zpages` configuration. The endpoint contents is a JSON map in which the keys
  `splunk.config.initial` and `splunk.config.effective` contains a string with the respective
  configuration YAML. This will be the replacement when the config debug endpoint is removed
  in the future. The `expvarz` endpoint can be disabled directly on the configuration file
  or via the command-line flags by use of `--set=extensions.zpages.expvar.enabled=false`
  when using the default configurations of the Splunk collector.
