  If you continue to experience issues reading journal files with the bundled journalctl binary, we recommend configuring your k8s Splunk OTEL Collector deployment to use the host journalctl instead.  
  For more details, see [Use the Host Journalctl binary](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/advanced-configuration.md#use-the-host-journalctl-binary).
  This option will be available starting with chart version 0.144.0.
