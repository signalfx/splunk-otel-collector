  When enabled, pod and node labels are sent as dimension properties in both their original form (with "." and "/")
  and sanitized form (with "_"). This allows users to receive both property formats during migration to k8s_cluster 
  receiver that don't sanitize label names, ensuring continuity of existing queries while adopting new naming
  conventions.
