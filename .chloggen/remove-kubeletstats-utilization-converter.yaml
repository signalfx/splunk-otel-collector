  The kubeletstats receiver's deprecated CPU utilization metrics have been completely removed in
  OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib v0.136.0, along with the `receiver.kubeletstats.enableCPUUsageMetrics` 
  feature gate. Users who were explicitly including these metrics in their SignalFx exporter 
  `include_metrics` configuration need to update their configs:
  
  - `container.cpu.utilization` → `container.cpu.usage`
  - `k8s.node.cpu.utilization` → `k8s.node.cpu.usage`
  - `k8s.pod.cpu.utilization` → `k8s.pod.cpu.usage`
  
  Note: The new `.cpu.usage` metrics show usage counted in CPUs (not a percentage of used resources).
  The previous metrics were incorrectly named using the "utilization" term.
  
  The Splunk distribution's config converter that automatically disabled these deprecated
  metrics has been removed to prevent collector startup failures.
