    This change means that metrics and logs sent to the gateway in the SignalFx format
    will no longer be subject to the batch and memory limiter processors configured in
    the gateway pipelines. Please ensure any required memory limiting or batching is
    configured on the sending side (e.g. the agent). Please note that the `signalfx` receiver
    will eventually be deprecated and removed.
