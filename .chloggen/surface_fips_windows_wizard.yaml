  You can set `GODEBUG` to turn on Go runtime FIPS 140-3 compatibility with the following values:
  * `GODEBUG=fips140=off` turn off any FIPS 140-3
  * `GODEBUG=fips140=on` turn on FIPS 140-3. This is the preferred setting in FedRAMP environments.
  * `GODEBUG=fips140=only` Experimental mode to disable any encryption mechanisms but FIPS 140-3 encryption.
    This mode is still under review by the Go team.
  See https://go.dev/doc/security/fips140 for further information.
