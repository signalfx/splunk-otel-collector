  The new variable is `SPLUNK_FILE_STORAGE_EXTENSION_PATH`, which is used for 
  setting where the filelog receiver's checkpoint files are stored. The default value
  for this flag is `/var/lib/otelcol/filelogs`. This is only relevant for the
  `logs_config_linux.yaml` configuration file at this time.
