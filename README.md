# Splunk distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

The Splunk distribution of [OpenTelemetry
Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) provides
a binary that can receive, process and export trace, metric and log data. This
distribution is supported by Splunk.

The Collector currently supports:

- [Splunk APM](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-apm.html) via the
  [`sapm`
  exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/sapmexporter).
  More information available
  [here](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/apm/apm-getting-started/apm-opentelemetry-collector.html).
- [Splunk Infrastructure
  Monitoring](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/infrastructure-monitoring.html)
  via the [`signalfx`
  exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/signalfxexporter).
  More information available
  [here](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/otel/imm-otel-collector.html).
- [Splunk Log Observer](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/splunk-log-observer.html) via
  the [`splunk_hec`
  exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/splunkhecexporter).
- [Splunk Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-cloud.html) or
  [Splunk
  Enterprise](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-enterprise.html) via
  the [`splunk_hec`
  exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/splunkhecexporter).

> :construction: This project is currently in **BETA**.

## Getting Started

The Collector provides a single binary and two deployment methods:

- Agent: A Collector instance running with the application or on the same host
  as the application (e.g. binary, sidecar, or daemonset).
- Gateway: One or more Collector instances running as a standalone service
  (e.g. container or deployment) typically per cluster, datacenter or region.

> Use of the Collector running as an agent is only supported for the [Splunk
Observability
Suite](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/splunk-observability-suite.html) at
this time. The [SignalFx Smart
Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent) or [Splunk Universal
Forwarder](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/8.1.2/Forwarder/Abouttheuniversalforwarder)
should be used for all other products.

The Collector is supported on and packaged for a variety of platforms including:

- Kubernetes
  - [Helm (recommended)](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart)
  - [YAML](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/master/exporter/sapmexporter/examples/signalfx-k8s.yaml)
- Linux
  - [Installer script (recommended)](./docs/getting-started/linux-installer.md)
  - [Standalone](./docs/getting-started/linux-standalone.md)
- Windows
  - [Installer script (recommended)](./docs/getting-started/windows-installer.md)
  - [Standalone](./docs/getting-started/windows-standalone.md)

You can consult additional use cases in the [examples](./examples) directory.

## Supported Components

The distribution offers support for the following components. Support is based
on the [OpenTelemetry maturity
matrix](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/47813530864b9fe5a5146f466a58bd2bb94edc72/maturity-matrix.yaml#L57).

## Sizing

The OpenTelemetry Collector can be scaled up or out as needed. Sizing is based
on the amount of data per data source and requires 1 CPU core per:

- Traces: 10,000 spans per second
- Metrics: 20,000 data points per second

If a Collector handles both trace and metric data then both must be accounted
for when sizing. For example, 5K spans per second plus 10K data points per
second would require 1 CPU core.

The recommendation is to use a ratio of 1 CPU to 2 GB of memory. By default, the
Collector is configured to use 512 MB of memory.

> The Collector does not persist data to disk so no disk space is required.

### Agent

For Agent instances, scale up resources as needed. Typically only a single
agent runs per application or host so properly sizing the agent is important.
Multiple independent agents could be deployed on a given application or host
depending on the use-case. For example, a privileged agent could be deployed
alongside an unprivileged agent.

### Gateway

For Gateway instances, allocate at least a CPU core per Collector. Note that
multiple Collectors can deployed behind a simple round-robin load balancer for
availability and performance reasons. Each Collector runs independently, so
scale increases linearly with the number of Collectors you deploy.

The recommendation is to configure at least N+1 redundancy, which means a load
balancer and a minimum of two Collector instances should be configured
initially.

## Monitoring

The default configuration automatically scrapes the Collector's own metrics and
sends the data using the `signalfx` exporter. A built-in dashboard provides
information about the health and status of Collector instances.

## Troubleshooting

See the [Collector troubleshooting
documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md).
Additional troubleshooting information can be found in the [getting
started](getting-started) READMEs.
