# Splunk distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

The Splunk distribution of [OpenTelemetry
Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) provides
a binary that can be deployed as a standalone service (also known as a gateway)
that can receive, process and export trace, metric and log data. The Collector
is an optional component that currently supports:

- [Splunk APM](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-apm.html) via the
  [`sapm`
  exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/sapmexporter).
  More information available
  [here](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/apm/apm-getting-started/apm-opentelemetry-collector.html).
- [Splunk Infrastructure
  Monitoring](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/infrastructure-monitoring.html)
  via the [`signalfx`
  exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/signalfxexporter).
  More information available
  [here](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/otel/imm-otel-collector.html).
- [Splunk Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-cloud.html) or
  [Splunk
  Enterprise](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-enterprise.html) via
  the [`splunk_hec`
  exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/splunkhecexporter).

The Collector is supported on and packaged for a variety of platforms including:

- Kubernetes: Helm and YAML
- Linux: All Intel, AMD and ARM systemd-based operating systems are supported
  including CentOS, Debian, Oracle, Red Hat and Ubuntu. DEB and RPM packages
  are also provided.
- Windows: EXE and MSI

> :construction: This project is currently in **BETA**.

## Getting Started

This distribution comes with [default
configurations](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/blob/main/cmd/otelcol/config/collector)
which require the following environment variables:

- `SPLUNK_REALM` (no default): Which realm to send the data to (for example: `us0`)
- `SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN` (no default): Access token to authenticate requests
- `SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB` (no default): How much memory to allocate to the ballast. This should be set to 1/3 to 1/2 of configured memory.

In addition, the following environment variables are optional:

- `SPLUNK_CONFIG` (default = `/etc/otel/collector/splunk-config_linux.yaml`): Which configuration to load.
- `SPLUNK_MEMORY_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE` (default = `90`): Maximum total memory to be allocated by the process heap.
- `SPLUNK_MEMORY_SPIKE_PERCENTAGE` (default = `20`): Maximum spike between the measurements of memory usage.

When running on a non-linux system, the following environment variables are required:

- `SPLUNK_CONFIG` (default = `/etc/otel/collector/splunk-config_non_linux.yaml`): Configuration to load.
- `SPLUNK_MEMORY_LIMIT_MIB` (no default): Maximum total memory to be allocated by the process heap.
- `SPLUNK_MEMORY_SPIKE_MIB` (no default): Maximum spike between the measurements of memory usage.

The following sections describe how to deploy the Collector in supported environments.

### Docker

Deploy from a Docker container. Replace `0.1.0` with the latest stable version number:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -e SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN=12345 -e SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB=683 \
    -e SPLUNK_REALM=us0 -p 13133:13133 -p 14250:14250 -p 14268:14268 -p 55678-55680:55678-55680 \
    -p 6060:6060 -p 7276:7276 -p 8888:8888 -p 9411:9411 -p 9943:9943 \
    --name otelcol quay.io/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector:0.1.0
```

### Kubernetes

To deploy in Kubernetes, create a configuration file that defines a ConfigMap,
Service, and Deployment for the cluster. For more information about creating a
configuration file, see the example
[signalfx-k8s.yaml](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/master/exporter/sapmexporter/examples/signalfx-k8s.yaml)
file on GitHub.

### Standalone

```bash
$ make otelcol
$ SPLUNK_REALM=us0 SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN=12345 SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB=683 \
    ./bin/otelcol
```

### Linux Installer Script

For non-containerized Linux environments, a convenience script is available for
installing the Collector package and [TD Agent
(Fluentd)](https://www.fluentd.org/).

Run the following command on your host. Replace `SPLUNK_REALM`,
`SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE`, and `SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN` for your
environment:

```sh
curl -sSL https://dl.signalfx.com/splunk-otel-collector.sh > /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh;
sudo sh /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh --realm SPLUNK_REALM --ballast SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE \
    -- SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

You can view the [source](internal/buildscripts/packaging/installer/install.sh)
for more details and other options.

Currently, only the following Linux distributions and versions are supported:

- Amazon Linux: 2
- CentOS / Red Hat / Oracle: 7, 8
- Debian: 8, 9, 10
- Ubuntu: 16.04, 18.04, 20.04

### Standalone Windows MSI (64-bit only)

A Windows MSI package is available to download at
[https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases
](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases) for versions
v0.4.0 or later.

To install, double-click on the downloaded package or run the following command
in a PowerShell terminal:

```sh
PS> Start-Process -Wait msiexec "/i PATH_TO_MSI /qn"
```

Replace `PATH_TO_MSI` with the *full* path to the downloaded package, e.g.
`C:\your\download\folder\splunk-otel-collector-0.4.0-amd64.msi`.

The collector will be installed to
`\Program Files\Splunk\OpenTelemetry Collector`, and the
`splunk-otel-collector` service will be created but not started.

A default config file will be copied to
`\ProgramData\Splunk\OpenTelemetry Collector\config.yaml` if it does not
already exist.  This file is required to start the `splunk-otel-collector`
service.

Before starting the `splunk-otel-collector` service, the following variables
in the default config file need to be replaced by the appropriate values for
your environment:

- `${SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN}`
- `${SPLUNK_REALM}`
- `${SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB}`
- `${SPLUNK_MEMORY_LIMIT_MIB}`
- `${SPLUNK_MEMORY_SPIKE_MIB}`

See the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section for details about these
variables.

After updating all variables in the config file, start the
`splunk-otel-collector` service by rebooting the system or running the
following command in a PowerShell terminal:

```sh
PS> Start-Service splunk-otel-collector
```

The collector logs and errors can be viewed in the Windows Event Viewer.

## Sizing

The OpenTelemetry Collector can be scaled up or out as needed. Sizing is based
on the amount of data per data source and requires 1 CPU core per:

- Traces: 10,000 spans per second
- Metrics: 20,000 data points per second

If a Collector handles both trace and metric data then both must be accounted
for when sizing. For example, 5K spans per second plus 10K data points per
second would require 1 CPU core.

The recommendation is to use a ratio of 1:2 for CPU:memory and to allocate at
least a CPU core per Collector. Multiple Collectors can deployed behind a
simple round-robin load balancer. Each Collector runs independently, so scale
increases linearly with the number of Collectors you deploy.

The Collector does not persist data to disk so no disk space is required.

## Advanced Configuration

### Command Line Arguments

Following the binary command or Docker container command line arguments can be
specified. Command line arguments take priority over environment variables.

For example in Docker:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -e SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN=12345 -e SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB=683 \
    -e SPLUNK_REALM=us0 -p 13133:13133 -p 14250:14250 -p 14268:14268 -p 55678-55680:55678-55680 \
    -p 6060:6060 -p 7276:7276 -p 8888:8888 -p 9411:9411 -p 9943:9943 \
    --name otelcol quay.io/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector:0.1.0 \
        --log-level=DEBUG
```

> Use `--help` to see all available CLI arguments.

### Custom Configuration

In addition to using the default configuration, a custom configuration can also
be provided. Use the `SPLUNK_CONFIG` environment variable or
the `--config` command line argument to provide a custom configuration.

> Command line arguments take precedence over environment variables. This
> applies to `--config` and `--mem-ballast-size-mib`.

For example in Docker:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -e SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN=12345 -e SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB=683 \
    -e SPLUNK_REALM=us0 -e SPLUNK_CONFIG=/etc/collector.yaml -p 13133:13133 -p 14250:14250 \
    -p 14268:14268 -p 55678-55680:55678-55680 -p 6060:6060 -p 7276:7276 -p 8888:8888 \
    -p 9411:9411 -p 9943:9943 -v collector.yaml:/etc/collector.yaml:ro \
    --name otelcol quay.io/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector:0.1.0
```

In the case of Docker, a volume mount may be required to load custom
configuration as shown above.

If the custom configuration includes a `memory_limiter` processor then the
`ballast_size_mib` parameter should be the same as the
`SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB` environment variable. See
[splunk_config.yaml](cmd/otelcol/config/collector/splunk_config.yaml) as an
example.

## Monitoring

The default configuration automatically scrapes the Collector's own metrics and
sends the data using the `signalfx` exporter. A built-in dashboard provides
information about the health and status of Collector instances.

## Troubleshooting

See the [Collector troubleshooting
documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md).
