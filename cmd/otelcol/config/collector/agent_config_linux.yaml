  # Enabling the memory_limiter is strongly recommended for every pipeline.
  # Configuration is based on the amount of memory allocated to the collector.
  # The configuration below assumes 2GB of memory. In general, the ballast
  # should be set to 1/3 of the collector's memory, the limit should be 90% of
  # the collector's memory up to 2GB, and the spike should be 25% of the
  # collector's memory up to 2GB. The simplest way to specify the ballast size is
  # set the value of SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB env variable. This will overrides
  # the value of --mem-ballast-size-mib command line flag. If SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB
  # is not defined then --mem-ballast-size-mib command line flag must be manually specified.
  # For more information about memory limiter, see
  # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/processor/memorylimiter/README.md
