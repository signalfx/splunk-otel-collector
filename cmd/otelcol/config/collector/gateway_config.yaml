  # Enabling the memory_limiter is strongly recommended for every pipeline.
  # Configuration is based on the amount of memory allocated to the collector.
  # In general, the ballast should be set to 1/3 of the collector's memory, the limit
  # should be 90% of the collector's memory up to 2GB. The simplest way to specify the
  # ballast size is set the value of SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB env variable. Alternatively, the
  # --mem-ballast-size-mib command line flag can be passed and take priority.
  # For more information about memory limiter, see
