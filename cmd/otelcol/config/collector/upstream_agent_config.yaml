# Minimum configuration file for the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution
# https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib

# The following environment variables are required to be manually defined or
# configured below:
# - SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN: The Splunk access token to authenticate requests
# - SPLUNK_API_URL: The Splunk API URL, e.g. https://api.us0.signalfx.com
# - SPLUNK_BALLAST_SIZE_MIB: This size of the ballast which should be 1/3 to 1/2 of memory allocated
# - SPLUNK_MEMORY_LIMIT_MIB: 90% of memory allocated
# - SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN: The Splunk HEC authentication token
# - SPLUNK_HEC_URL: The Splunk HEC endpoint URL, e.g. https://ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v1/log
# - SPLUNK_INGEST_URL: The Splunk ingest URL, e.g. https://ingest.us0.signalfx.com
# - SPLUNK_TRACE_URL: The Splunk trace endpoint URL, e.g. https://ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v2/trace
