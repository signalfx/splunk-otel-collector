# Beta Definition

The OpenTelemetry Collector project is currently in beta with a defined [roadmap
to
GA](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/ga-roadmap.md).
Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector is beta in part because it is a distribution of
the OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Is Splunk support provided in beta?

Yes. Customers that use Splunk OpenTelemetry distributions, such as Splunk
OpenTelemetry Connector, can receive direct help from Splunk support even while
the distributions are in beta. Customers are free to use the core OpenTelemetry
OSS components (several do!) and Splunk will provide best effort guidance for
any issues experienced. Only Splunk OpenTelemetry distributions are in scope
for official Splunk support and support-related SLAs.

## What does beta mean?

Beta primarily means that a breaking change may be introduced in a new release.
Breaking changes may include:

- Rename or removal of a configuration option
- Removal of or change of functionality in a [component](components.md)
