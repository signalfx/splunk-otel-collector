# Splunk Forwarder Integration

> WARNING: The following is not supported or tested today. Performance testing,
> sizing guidelines, and latency impact are not provided. Multiline messages
> may not work properly. Other limitations or issues may exist.

Use-case: An existing Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud customer with the
Universal or Heavy Forwarder already deployed wants to send some/all data
from the forwarder to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

It is possible, but not supported, to configure a
Splunk Forwarder to send data to Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector in the
following ways:

- Splunk Universal Forwarder with TCP out to Fluentd in Splunk OpenTelemetry
  Collector
- Splunk Heavy Forwarder with either TCP or Syslog out to Fluentd in Splunk
  OpenTelemetry Collector

Please note that there are differences between a Universal and Heavy Forwarder:

- Read
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Forwarding/Typesofforwarders
- Neither the UF nor HF adds Splunk leveraged metadata (e.g. source,
  sourcetype, and host) when forwarding in TCP
- UF supports all-or-nothing forwarding; HF offers flexibility

The most common deployment models to test Splunk Forwarder integration are:

- UF > TCP out > Fluentd (via Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector)
- UF > S2S out > HF > TCP out > Fluentd (via Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector)

## Configuring Universal or Heavy Forwarder

The minimum way to configure with the UF or HF to export data in TCP form is to
add something like the following to `outputs.conf`:

```
[tcpout:fastlane]
server = 127.0.0.1:20001
sendCookedData = false
```

> The `server` configuration above assume the UF/HF and Splunk OpenTelemetry
> Collector are running on the same application. If they are separate, this
> parameter will need to be updated.

Please be advised that advanced configuration may be required to configure
things including TLS, throttling, buffering, parallelism, etc. For more
information, see documentation including:

- [Outputs.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Admin/Outputsconf)
- [Multiple pipelinesets](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/8.1.2/Forwarder/Configureaforwardertohandlemultiplepipelinesets)

## Configuring Fluentd in Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector

A new source will need to be added to the `conf.d/` directory that Fluentd
monitors. For example, `tcp.conf` could be added with the following:

```
<source>
   @type tcp
   @label @SPLUNK
   tag tcp.events
   port 20001
   bind 0.0.0.0
   delimiter "\n"
   <parse>
     @type "none"
   </parse>
 </source>
```

> The `@label @SPLUNK` configuration is critical as by default Fluentd only
> collects events with this label.

Multiline events are likely to be an issue with the example configuration
above. Consider configuring the Fluentd [multiline
parser](https://docs.fluentd.org/parser/multiline) to address this.
