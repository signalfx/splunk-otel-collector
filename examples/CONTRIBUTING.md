This document is specific for contributing examples to the splunk-otel project, not for the project overall. All the guidelines in the top-level [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) still apply.

# Examples-specific guidelines

Please add documentation for any new examples to the "examples/README.md" folder. For any configuration that requires a token, mention such in both the relative configuration file and the README.

All examples should be runnable via docker and configured by a example-specific `docker-compose.yml` file.
