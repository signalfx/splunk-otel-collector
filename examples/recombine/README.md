# Recombining logs

This example showcases how the collector can read logs and recombine them.

The example runs as a Docker Compose deployment. The collector is configured to send logs to Splunk Enterprise.

Splunk is configured to receive data from the OpenTelemetry Collector using the HTTP Event collector. To learn more about HEC, visit [our guide](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/dataapps/httpeventcollector/).

To deploy the example, check out this git repository, open a terminal and in this directory type:
```bash
$> docker-compose up
```

Splunk will become available on port 18000. You can login on [http://localhost:18000](http://localhost:18000) with `admin` and `changeme`.

Once logged in, visit the [search application](http://localhost:18000/en-US/app/search) to see just one log collected by Splunk, recombined from the 2 logs present in input.json.
