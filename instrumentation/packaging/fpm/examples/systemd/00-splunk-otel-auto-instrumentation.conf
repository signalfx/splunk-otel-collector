# Sample systemd drop-in file to activate and configure Splunk OpenTelemetry Auto Instrumentation for Java and Node.js
# https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/get-data-in/application/java/get-started.html
# https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/get-data-in/application/nodejs/get-started.html

# To use this file to activate/configure auto instrumentation for all supported applications running as systemd
# services (requires root privileges):
#  1. Check agent compatibility and requirements:
#     - Java: https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/get-data-in/application/java/java-otel-requirements.html for
#     - Node.js: https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/get-data-in/application/nodejs/nodejs-otel-requirements.html
#  2. Check supported environment variables and defaults:
#     - Java: https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/get-data-in/application/java/configuration/advanced-java-otel-configuration.html
#     - Node.js: https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/get-data-in/application/nodejs/configuration/advanced-nodejs-otel-configuration.html
#  3. If Node.js is required, install the provided Node.js auto instrumentation package with npm and any dependencies.
#     For example:
#     $ sudo npm install --global /usr/lib/splunk-instrumentation/splunk-otel-js.tgz
#     Important: Ensure that all Node.js services to be instrumented has access to the installation path.
#  4. Add/Update the DefaultEnvironment entries below for the desired environment variables and values
#  5. Copy this file to the systemd configuration directory, e.g. /usr/lib/systemd/system.conf.d/
#  6. Reboot the system or run the following commands to restart the applicable service(s) for any changes to take effect:
#     $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
#     $ sudo systemctl restart <service-name>   # replace "<service-name>" and run for each applicable service

# See https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-system.conf.html for general information
# about systemd configuration and other supported options.
