  # Detect if the collector is running on a cloud system, which is important for creating unique cloud provider dimensions.
  # Detector order is important: the `system` detector goes last so it can't preclude cloud detectors from setting host/os info.
  # Resource detection processor is configured to override all host and cloud attributes because instrumentation
  # libraries can send wrong values from container environments.
