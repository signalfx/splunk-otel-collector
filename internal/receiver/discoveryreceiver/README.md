The Discovery receiver is a receiver that discovers and monitors the functional status
of services reported by Observer extensions. It works similarly to the
[Receiver Creator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/receivercreator/README.md)
(it actually wraps an internal instance of one) and passes through metrics from dynamically-instantiated receivers
to your metrics pipelines while simultaneously evaluating them using pre-bundled status rules for each receiver type.

The receiver emits experimental entity events as log records for discovered services. These entity events indicate
the operational status (`successful`, `partial`, or `failed`) of each discovered service based on:
- Metrics emitted by the receiver for that service
- Component-level log statements from the receiver via [zap.Logger](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/zap)

Status evaluation rules are pre-bundled for each supported receiver type and cannot be configured by users.
The first matching rule determines the status of the endpoint.

The receiver emits entity events for 
[Endpoints](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/extension/observer/endpoints.go)
discovered by the specified `watch_observers` if they match a rule for any configured receiver.

## Example Usage

The following Collector configuration will create a Discovery receiver instance that receives
endpoints from a [Kubernetes Observer](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/extension/observer/k8sobserver/README.md)
and reports entity events denoting the status of discovered services. For example, it will automatically discover and monitor
[MySQL receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/mysqlreceiver/README.md) instances.

The receiver uses pre-bundled status rules for the `mysql` receiver type:

* `successful` if it emits any `mysql.locks` metrics, denoting that metric gathering and the receiver are functional.
* `partial` if it internally logs a statement matching the `Access denied for user` pattern, suggesting
there is a MySQL server but it's receiving incorrect credentials.
* `failed` if it internally logs a statement matching the `Can't connect to MySQL server on .* [(]111[)]` pattern,
suggesting that no MySQL server is available at the endpoint.

These status rules are pre-defined and cannot be modified in the configuration.

```yaml
extensions:
  k8s_observer:
    auth_type: serviceAccount
    node: ${K8S_NODE_NAME}
receivers:
   discovery:
     watch_observers: [k8s_observer]
     receivers:
       mysql:
         rule: type == "port" and port != 33060 and pod.name matches "(?i)mysql"
         config:
           username: root
           password: root
exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  extensions:
    - k8s_observer
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers:
        - discovery
      exporters:
        - debug
    metrics:
      receivers:
        - discovery
      exporters:
        - debug
```

Given this configuration, if the Discovery receiver's Kubernetes observer instance reports an active MySQL container, and
the `mysql` receiver is able to generate metrics for the container, the receiver will emit the following entity event:

```
2024-04-08T06:08:58.204Z	info	LogsExporter	{"kind": "exporter", "data_type": "logs", "name": "debug", "resource logs": 1, "log records": 1}

```

Instead, if the Docker observer reports an active MySQL container but the provided authentication information is
incorrect, the Discovery receiver will emit something similar to the following log record:

If the Kubernetes observer reports an unrelated container that isn't running MySQL, the following entity event would be emitted:

**Note**: Status evaluation rules (`metrics` and `statements` matching) are pre-bundled for each receiver type and cannot be configured by users. The receiver automatically uses the appropriate pre-defined status rules based on the receiver type.

## Entity Events and Status

The discovery receiver emits experimental entity events as log records for discovered services. Each entity event log record includes:

* `otel.entity.event.type` attribute set to `entity_state`  
* `otel.entity.id` attribute containing the unique endpoint identifier
* `otel.entity.attributes` attribute containing service metadata and discovery information
* `discovery.status` attribute with `successful`, `partial`, or `failed` status based on pre-bundled evaluation rules
* `discovery.event.type` attribute indicating whether the status was determined by `metric.match` or `statement.match`

The receiver also passes through metrics from discovered services to metrics pipelines while using them for status evaluation.
