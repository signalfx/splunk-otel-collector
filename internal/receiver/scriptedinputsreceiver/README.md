## Overview
The scripted inputs receiver is a component that performs log collection equivalent to what the UF does when the
[Unix and Linux Technical Add-on](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/UnixLinux/About) is installed.

The following settings are required:

- `script_name` : Name of the script to be executed.
- `collection_interval` : (default = `60s`) how often the script should be executed


The following settings are optional:

- `source` : source of the event
- `sourcetype` : sourcetype of the event
- `multiline` : how the standard output of the script is split, works exactly the same way as the [multiline setting](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver#multiline-configuration) of filelog receiver
Example:

```yaml
receivers:
  scripted_inputs/df:
    script_name: df
    collection_interval: 10s
    source: df
    sourcetype: df
    multiline:
      line_end_pattern: '\n'
```


```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [scripted_inputs/df]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [splunk_hec]
```
