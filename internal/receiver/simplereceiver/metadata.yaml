# "Receivers can contain a metadata.yaml file that documents the metrics that may be emitted by the receiver."
# I have not seen this referenced in the documentation at all, but if you want your receiver to emit metrics, 
# this is the simplest way to generate the code to support it.
#
# The file format documentation can be found here: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/cmd/mdatagen
