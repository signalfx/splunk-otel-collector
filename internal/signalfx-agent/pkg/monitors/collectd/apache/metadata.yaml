    Monitors Apache webservice instances using the information provided by

    ### Worker states
    Apache worker threads can be in one of the following states:

    | State        | Remark                                  |
    |--------------|-----------------------------------------|
    | Open         | Open (unused) slot - no process         |
    | Waiting      | Idle and waiting for request            |
    | Sending      | Serving response                        |
    | KeepAlive    | Kept alive for possible next request    |
    | Idle_cleanup | Idle and marked for cleanup             |
    | Closing      | Closing connection                      |
    | Logging      | Writing to log file                     |
    | Reading      | Reading request                         |

    | Starting     | Starting up to serve                    |

    <!--- SETUP --->
    ## Apache Setup
    To configure the Apache webserver itself to expose status metrics:

    1. Enable the <a target="_blank" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html">mod_status</a> module in your Apache server.
    2. Add the following configuration to your Apache server:

       ```
        ExtendedStatus on
        <Location /mod_status>
        SetHandler server-status
        </Location>
       ```
    3. Restart Apache.

    _Note_: Make sure that the URL you provide for your `mod_status` module
    ends in `?auto`. This returns the status page as `text/plain`, which this
    plugin requires.

    <!--- SETUP --->
    ## Config Examples

    ```
    monitors:
     - type: collectd/apache
       host: localhost
       port: 80
    ```

    If `mod_status` is exposed on an endpoint other than `/mod_status`, you can
    use the `url` config option to specify the path:

    ```
    monitors:
     - type: collectd/apache
       host: localhost
       port: 80
       url: "http://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/server-status?auto"
    ```

    For a full list of options, see [Configuration](#configuration).

  metrics:
    apache_bytes:
      description: Amount of data served by Apache, in bytes.
      default: true
      type: cumulative
    apache_connections:
      description: >
        The number of connections that are being served by Apache.  This is
        also equal to the number of busy worker threads, where 'busy' means any
        worker thread which has been started successfully and is not slated for
        idle cleanup.
      default: true
      type: gauge
    apache_idle_workers:
      description: >
        The number of Apache workers that are idling. If this number is
        consistently low, then your server may be too busy and you may have to
        increase the number of threads.  If it is consistently high, then the
        system may be under-utilized.
      default: true
      type: gauge
    apache_requests:
      description: >
        The number of requests that have been served by Apache. This metric is
        useful to know total requests and the rate at which Apache is able to
        serve them.
      default: true
      type: cumulative
    apache_scoreboard.closing:
      description: >
        This metric shows how many worker threads are in the process of closing
        TCP connections after serving a response. If this number is
        consistently high, then there might be a network issue or errant client
        preventing TCP tear-down.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    apache_scoreboard.dnslookup:
      description: >
        This metric counts the number of worker threads that are performing a
        DNS lookup. If this number is too high, check if there is a DNS
        resolution problem at your server. This can affect Apache server
        performance.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    apache_scoreboard.finishing:
      description: The number of worker threads that are finishing as part of graceful server shutdown.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    apache_scoreboard.idle_cleanup:
      description: The number of worker threads that are idle and ready for clean-up.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    apache_scoreboard.keepalive:
      description: >
        The number of worker threads that are maintaining keep-alive
        connections: keeping the connection "alive" after serving a response, in
        the expectation that another HTTP request will come on the same
        connection. At the end of the keep-alive interval, the connection is
        closed.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    apache_scoreboard.logging:
      description: >
        This metric shows how many worker threads are busy writing to the log
        file.  If this number is consistently high, your logging level may be
        too high or one or more modules may be too verbose.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    apache_scoreboard.open:
      description: >
        This metric shows how many worker slots are open.  The slots do not
        have a worker thread yet, but they can be spun up based on incoming
        requests.
      default: true
      type: gauge
    apache_scoreboard.reading:
      description: >
        This metric shows how many workers are in the process of receiving
        requests (headers or body).  If this number is consistently high,
        clients may be sending large headers or uploading large files.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    apache_scoreboard.sending:
      description: >
        This metric shows how many workers are sending responses.  It is normal

        downloads.
      default: false

    apache_scoreboard.starting:

        This metric shows how many workers are being started up.  If this
        number is consistently high, then the system may be overloaded.
