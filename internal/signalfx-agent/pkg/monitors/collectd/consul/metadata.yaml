    <!--- SETUP --->
    ## Agent Statsd listener
    If running Consul version below 0.9.1, configure the Consul agents that are
    to be monitored to send telemetry to a SignalFx Agent instance by adding
    the below configuration to Consul agents configuration file:

    ```
    {"telemetry":
      {"statsd_address": "<agent host>:<agent port, default 8125>"}
    }
    ```
    This monitor should then be be configured with the `telemetryServer: true`
    option set. This will start a UDP server listening on `0.0.0.0:8125` by
    default.
