    **This monitor is deprecated in favor of the `cpu` monitor.  Please switch
    to that monitor, as this monitor will be removed in a future agent
    release.**

    This monitor collects cpu usage data using the
    collectd `cpu` plugin.  It aggregates the per-core CPU data into a single
    metric and sends it to the SignalFx Metadata plugin in collectd, where the
    raw jiffy counts from the `cpu` plugin are converted to percent utilization
    (the `cpu.utilization` metric).

    See https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:CPU
  # There are no included metrics but shouldn't sendAll by default.

  metrics:
    cpu.idle:
      description: >
        CPU time spent not in any other state. In order to get a percentage
        this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states.
      group:
      default: true
      type: cumulative
    cpu.interrupt:
      description: >
        CPU time spent while servicing hardware interrupts. A hardware
        interrupt happens at the physical layer. When this occurs, the CPU will
        stop whatever else it is doing and service the interrupt. This metric
        measures how many jiffies were spent handling these interrupts. In
        order to get a percentage this value must be compared against the sum
        of all CPU states. A sustained high value for this metric may be caused
        by faulty hardware such as a broken peripheral.
      group:
      default: false
      type: cumulative
    cpu.nice:
      description: >
        CPU time spent in userspace running 'nice'-ed processes. In order to
        get a percentage this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU
        states. A sustained high value for this metric may be caused by: 1) The
        server not having enough CPU capacity for a process, 2) A programming
        error which causes a process to use an unexpected amount of CPU
      group:
      default: false
      type: cumulative
    cpu.softirq:
      description: >
        CPU time spent while servicing software interrupts. Unlike a hardware
        interrupt, a software interrupt happens at the sofware layer. Usually
        it is a userspace program requesting a service of the kernel. This
        metric measures how many jiffies were spent by the CPU handling these
        interrupts. In order to get a percentage this value must be compared
        against the sum of all CPU states. A sustained high value for this
        metric may be caused by a programming error which causes a process to
        unexpectedly request too many services from the kernel.
      group:
      default: false
      type: cumulative
    cpu.steal:
      description: >
        CPU time spent waiting for a hypervisor to service requests from other
        virtual machines. This metric is only present on virtual machines. This
        metric records how much time this virtual machine had to wait to have the
        hypervisor kernel service a request. In order to get a percentage this
        value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states. A sustained
        high value for this metric may be caused by: 1) Another VM on the same
        hypervisor using too many resources, or 2) An underpowered hypervisor
      group:
      default: false
      type: cumulative
    cpu.system:
      description: >
        CPU time spent running in the kernel. This value reflects how often
        processes are calling into the kernel for services (e.g to log to the
        console). In order to get a percentage this value must be compared
        against the sum of all CPU states. A sustained high value for this metric
        may be caused by: 1) A process that needs to be re-written to use kernel
        resources more efficiently, or 2) A userspace driver that is broken
      group:
      default: false
      type: cumulative
    cpu.user:
      description: >
        CPU time spent running in userspace. In order to get a percentage
        this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states. If this value is
        high: 1) A process requires more CPU to run than is available on the server, or
        2) There is an application programming error which is causing the CPU to be
        used unexpectedly.
      group:
      default: false
      type: cumulative
    cpu.wait:
      description: >
        Amount of total CPU time spent idle while waiting for an I/O operation
        to complete. In order to get a percentage this value must be compared
        against the sum of all CPU states. A high value for a sustained period
        may be caused by: 1) A slow hardware device that is taking too long to
        service requests, or 2) Too many requests being sent to an I/O device
