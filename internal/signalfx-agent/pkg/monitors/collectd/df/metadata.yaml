    Tracks free disk space on the host using the collectd [df
    plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:DF).

    Note that on Linux a filesystem **must** be mounted in the same filesystem
    namespace that the agent is running in for this monitor to be able to
    collect statistics about that filesystem.  This is mostly an issue when
    running the agent in a container.

    df_complex.free:
      description: |-
        Measures free disk space in bytes on this file system.
      default: true
      type: gauge
    df_complex.reserved:
      description: |-
        Measures disk space in bytes reserved for the super-user on this file system.
      default: false

    df_complex.used:
      description: |-
        Measures used disk space in bytes on this file system.
