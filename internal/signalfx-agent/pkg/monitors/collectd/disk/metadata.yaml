    This monitor collects information about the usage of
    physical disks and logical disks (partitions).

    See https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Disk.

    **This monitor has been deprecated in favor of the `disk-io` monitor.
    Please migrate to that monitor as this collectd-based monitor will be
    removed in a future release of the agent.**  Note that the `disk-io`
    monitor has a different dimension (`disk` instead of `plugin_instance`) to
    specify the disk.
