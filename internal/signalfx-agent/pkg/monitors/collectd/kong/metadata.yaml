    Monitors a Kong instance using
    [collectd-kong](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong).  The Smart
    Agent includes collectd and this plugin as part of the standard
    installation, so no additional installation is required once you have the
    Smart Agent.

    The SignalFx Kong collectd plugin provides users with the ability to gather
    and report their service traffic metrics with collectd, in tandem with
    [kong-plugin-signalfx](https://github.com/signalfx/kong-plugin-signalfx).

    This plugin emits metrics for configurable request/response lifecycle groups including:

    * Counters for response counts
    * Counters for cumulative response and request sizes
    * Counters for cumulative request, upstream, and Kong latencies

    These request/response lifecycle groups can be optionally partitioned by tunable levels of granularity by:

    * API or Service Name/ID
    * Route ID
    * Request HTTP Method
    * Response HTTP Status Code

    In addition to these groups, system-wide connection stats can be provided, including:

    * A counter for total fielded requests
    * Gauges for active connections and their various states
    * A gauge for database connectivity

    The `metrics` field below is populated with a set of metrics that are
    described at https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong/blob/master/README.md.
