    Collectd Python plugin that aggregates various metrics from other collectd
    plugins.

    It has deprecated functionality to send host metadata and process "top"
    info, but this has been replaced by the `host-metadata` and `processlist`
    monitors, respectively.

    You can also [view the Python plugin
    code](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-signalfx/).
