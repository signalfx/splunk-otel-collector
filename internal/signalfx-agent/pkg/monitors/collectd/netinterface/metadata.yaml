    Collectd stats about network interfaces on the
    system by using the [collectd interface
    plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Interface).

    **This monitor is deprecated in favor of the `net-io` monitor. Please
    switch to that monitor as this monitor will be removed in a future release
    of the agent.**  Note that the `net-io` monitor uses the `interface`
    dimension to identify the network card instead of the `plugin_instance`
    dimension, but otherwise the metrics are the same.
