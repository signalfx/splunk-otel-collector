      This monitor collects metadata from a Heroku dyno and syncs them as properties
      to `dyno_id` dimension, which is synced by datapoints emitted by the
      [Heroku SignalFx Collector (https://github.com/signalfx/heroku-signalfx-collector).

      Metadata on Heroku dyno's need to be enabled explicitly. For information about this,
      see [here] (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata).
