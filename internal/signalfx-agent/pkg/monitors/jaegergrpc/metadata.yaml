    The jaegergrpc monitor is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    Use the jaegerreceiver instead.
    
    Runs a GRPC server that listens for Jaeger trace batches
    and forwards them to SignalFx (or the configured ingest host in the
    `writer` section of the agent config).  By default, the server listens on
    localhost port 14250 but can be configured to anything.
