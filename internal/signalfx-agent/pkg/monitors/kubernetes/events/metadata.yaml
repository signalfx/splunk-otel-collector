    This monitor sends Kubernetes events as SignalFx
    events.  Upon startup, it will send all of the events that K8s has that are
    still persisted and then send any new events that come in.  The various
    agents perform leader election amongst themselves to decide which instance
    will send events, unless the `alwaysClusterReporter` config option is set to
    true.

    To use this monitor, will need to configure which events to send. You can
    see the types of events happening in your cluster with
    `kubectl get events -o yaml --all-namespaces`.
    From the output, you can select which events you would like to send by picking
    out the Reason (Started, Created, Scheduled...) and
    Kind (Pod, ReplicaSet, Deployment...) combinations. These are placed in the
    whitelistedEvents configuration option as a list of events you want to send.

    Example YAML Configuration

    ```
    - type: kubernetes-events
      whitelistedEvents:
        - reason: Created
          involvedObjectKind: Pod
        - reason: SuccessfulCreate
          involvedObjectKind: ReplicaSet
    ```

    Event names will match the `reason` name.
