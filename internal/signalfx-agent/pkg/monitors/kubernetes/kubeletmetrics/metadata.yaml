monitors:
- monitorType: kubelet-metrics
  doc: |
    This monitor pulls container metrics from a Kubernetes kubelet instance via
    the `/stats/summary` endpoint.

    This montior is intended to replace the `kubelet-stats` monitor that
    relied on now deprecated endpoints in the kubelet.  It does not get as
    many metrics but the important ones are there.

    Metrics about container cpu/memory limits and requests come from the
    [kubernetes-cluster](./kubernetes-cluster.md) monitor.

    For the mounted volumes metrics that are also emitted by the
    `/stats/summary` endpoint, see the
    [kubernetes-volumes](./kubernetes-volumes.md) monitor.

    To monitor the kubelet instance itself, via the `/metrics` endpoint, use
    the [prometheus-exporter](./prometheus-exporter.md) monitor and point it to
    that endpoint.

  metrics:
    container_cpu_utilization:
      description: 'Cumulative cpu utilization in percentages.  This is equivalent
        to "centicores", or hundreths of CPU cores consumed.  This metric is **NOT**
        normalized by the total # of cores on the system.'
      default: true
      type: cumulative

    # Root filesystem
    container_fs_available_bytes:
      description: The storage space available (bytes) for the container root filesystem
      default: true
      type: gauge

    container_fs_capacity_bytes:
      description: The total capacity (bytes) of the container root filesystem's underlying storage
      type: gauge
      default: true

    container_fs_usage_bytes:
      description: |
        This is the bytes used by the container rootfs on the filesystem. This
        may differ from the total bytes used on the filesystem and may not
        equal container_fs_capacity_bytes - container_fs_available_bytes.

      type: gauge

    ## MEMORY
    container_memory_available_bytes:
      description: |
        Available memory for use.  This is defined as the memory limit -
        container_memory_working_set_bytes. If memory limit is undefined, this
        metric is omitted.
      default: false
      type: gauge

    container_memory_rss_bytes:
      type: gauge
      default: false
      description: The amount of anonymous and swap cache memory (includes transparent hugepages)

    container_memory_usage_bytes:
      description: "Total memory in use -- this includes all memory regardless of when it was accessed."
      default: true
      type: gauge

    container_memory_working_set_bytes:
      description: |
        The amount of working set memory. This includes recently accessed
        memory, dirty memory, and kernel memory. container_memory_working_set_bytes is <=
        container_memory_usage_bytes.
      default: false
      type: gauge

    container_memory_page_faults:
      description: Cumulative number of minor page faults.

    # Pod Ephemeral Storage
    pod_ephemeral_storage_capacity_bytes:
      description: Represents the storage space available (bytes) for the filesystem.
        This value is a combination of total filesystem usage for the containers and
        emptyDir-backed volumes in the measured Pod. See more about emptyDir-backed

        filesystem usage for the containers and emptyDir-backed volumes in the measured Pod.
