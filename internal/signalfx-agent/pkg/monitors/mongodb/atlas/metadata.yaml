    MongoDB Atlas is a provider of MongoDB as an on-demand fully managed service. Atlas exposes MongoDB cluster
    monitoring and logging data through its [monitoring and logs](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/api/monitoring-and-logs/)
    REST API endpoints. These Atlas monitoring API resources are grouped into measurements for MongoDB processes,
    host disks and MongoDB databases.

    This monitor repeatedly scrapes MongoDB monitoring data from Atlas at the configured time interval. It scrapes the
    process and disk measurements into metric groups called mongodb and hardware. The original measurement names are
    included in the metric descriptions. A set of data points are fetched at the configured granularity and period for
    each measurement. Metric values are set to the latest non-empty data point value in the set. The finest granularity
    supported by Atlas is 1 minute. The configured period for the monitor needs to be wider than the interval at which
    Atlas provides values for measurements. Otherwise some of the sets of fetched data points will contain only empty
    values. The default configured period is 20 minutes which works across all measurements and gives a reasonable
    response payload size.

    Below is an excerpt of the agent configuration yaml showing the minimal required fields. Note that
    `disableHostDimensions` is set to true so that the host name in which the agent/monitor is running is not used for
    the `host` metric dimension value. The names of the MongoDB cluster hosts from which metrics emanate are used
    instead.
