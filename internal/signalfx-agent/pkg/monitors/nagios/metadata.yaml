    Wrapper to run existing nagios status check scripts through SignalFx agent which will play the 
    role of NRPE or SNMP exec.

    It will run the script set in `command` parameter and send the 
    [state](https://nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html#AEN78) of the check depending on the 
    exit code of the command.

    It is very similar to [telegraf/exec](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/gdi/exec/telegraf-exec.html) 
    monitor configured with `dataFormat: nagios` but:
      - it does not retrieve perfdata metrics, only the state of the script for alerting purpose.
      - it will override the state if exit code == 0 but output string starts with `warn`, `crit` or `unkn` 
      (not case sensitive).

    Also the main advantage and purpose of this monitor is to add more context to this status check state 
    thougth SignalFx [events](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/metrics-and-metadata/view-data-events.html).
    Indeed, in addition to the state metric, it will send an event which includes the output and the error 
    caught from the command execution.

    This should make the troubleshooting more efficient and allow the user to remain in SignalFx without 
    to have to connect to the machine in case of anormal state to understand what is happening.
    It will also give the ability to create a dashboard similar to what nagios user are accustomed to.

    __Note__: the last sent event is cached into memory to avoid sending the same event for each collection 
    interval over and over but already sent event will be send again when you restart the agent erasing its 
    cache. If your check always "normally" produces a different output for each run like the uptime check 
    does so you can use the `FilterStdOut: true` parameter to ignore it in comparison.
