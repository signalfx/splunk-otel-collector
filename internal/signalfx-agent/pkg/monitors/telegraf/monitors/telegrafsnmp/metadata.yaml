    This monitor reports metrics from snmp agents.
    This monitor is based on the Telegraf SNMP plugin.  More information about the Telegraf plugin
    can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/snmp).

    **NOTE:** This snmp monitor does not currently support MIB look ups because of a dependency on `net-snmp`
    and specifically the commands `snmptranslate` and `snmptable`.

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
     - type: telegraf/snmp
       agents:
         - "127.0.0.1:161"
       version: 2
       community: "public"
       fields:
         - name: "uptime"
           oid: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0"
    ```

    Using a discovery rule to discover and configure for a specific snmp agent
    ```yaml
    monitors:
     - type: telegraf/snmp
       discoveryRule: container_name =~ "snmp" && port == 161
       version: 2
       community: "public"
       fields:
         - name: "uptime"
           oid: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0"
    ```
  metrics:
  monitorType: telegraf/snmp
  properties:
  sendAll: true
