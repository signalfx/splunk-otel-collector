    This is an embedded form of the [Telegraf Varnish
    plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/varnish).

    Keep in mind this monitor will use `varnishstat` command so the signalfx-agent needs
    to be run on the same host as the varnish server.

    Also, signalfx-agent should have permission to run this command properly:

    ```bash
    usermod -a -G varnish signalfx-agent
    ```

    For more information check [telegraf official documentation](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/varnish#permissions)
    but do not forget to adapt commands using `signalfx-agent` instead of `telegraf`.
