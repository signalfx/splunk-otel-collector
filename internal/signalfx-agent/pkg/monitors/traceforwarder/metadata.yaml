    Runs an HTTP server that listens for trace spans
    and forwards them to SignalFx (or the configured ingest host in the `writer`
    section of the agent config).  This supports the same span formats that our
    ingest server supports and at the same path (`/v1/trace`).  By default, the
    server listens on localhost port 9080 but can be configured to anything.
