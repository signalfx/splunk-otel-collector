    (Windows Only) This monitor reports metrics for Windows Internet Information Services.
    It is used to drive the Windows IIS dashboard content.

    ## Windows Performance Counters
    The underlying source for these metrics are Windows Performance Counters.
    Most of the performance counters that we query in this monitor are actually Gauges
    that represent rates per second and percentages.

    This monitor reports the instantaneous values for these Windows Performance Counters.
    This means that in between a collection interval, spikes could occur on the
    Performance Counters.  The best way to mitigate this limitation is to increase
    the reporting interval on this monitor to collect more frequently.

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
     - type: windows-iis
    ```
  metrics:
    process.handle_count:
      description: The total number of handles currently open by this process. This
        number is equal to the sum of the handles currently open by each thread in
        this process.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    process.id_process:
      description: The unique identifier of this process. ID Process numbers are reused,
        so they only identify a process for the lifetime of that process.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    process.pct_processor_time:
      description: The percentage of elapsed time that all process threads used the
        processor to execution instructions. Code executed to handle some hardware
        interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    process.private_bytes:
      description: The current size, in bytes, of memory that this process has allocated
        that cannot be shared with other processes.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    process.thread_count:
      description: The number of threads currently active in this process. Every running
        process has at least one thread.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    process.virtual_bytes:
      description: The current size, in bytes, of the virtual address space the process
        is using. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding
        use of either disk or main memory pages. Virtual space is finite, and the
        process can limit its ability to load libraries.
      default: false
      type: gauge
    process.working_set:
      description: The current size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process.
        The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads
        in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages
        are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use. When
        free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets.
        If they are needed, they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set
        before leaving main memory.
      default: false
