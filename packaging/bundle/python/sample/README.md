# Python Monitor Samples

These are some sample scripts for the
[python-monitor](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/docs/monitors/python-monitor.md).
They can be used as inspiration and guidance on how to write your own scripts.
Contributions are also welcome but the scripts here are not officially
supported.
