# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v1.7.0

- Updates addon to use collector version v0.137.0
- Remove signalfx receiver `access_token_passthrough` configuration option from TA configuration files. This option was
  deprecated in v0.135.0 and is now removed. If you were using this option, you should use `include_metadata: true` instead. 

## v1.6.0

- Updates addon to use collector version v0.135.0
- Removed `splunk_otel_log_file` configuration option. In unmanaged scenarios, this file
  would grow in case of errors and would not be rotated or truncated by operators, leading
  to problems with disk space use. Now, by default, the OTel Collector will log errors
  to `splunkd.log` on all platforms. If you want more detailed logging or if you want to log to a different file,
  you can modify the `service.telemetry.logs` section in the YAML files under the `configs/` directory of the add-on ([#6748](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/pull/6748)).
