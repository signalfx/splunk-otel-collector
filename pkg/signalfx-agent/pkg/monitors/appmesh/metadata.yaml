    This monitor starts a StatsD monitor to listen to StatsD metrics emitted
    by AWS AppMesh Envoy Proxy.

    To report AppMesh Envoy metrics, you need to enable Envoy StatsD sink on AppMesh
    and deploy the agent as a sidecar in the services that need to be monitored.


    Sample Envoy StatsD configuration:

    ```yaml
    stats_sinks:
     -
      name: "envoy.statsd"
      config:
       address:
        socket_address:
         address: "127.0.0.1"
         port_value: 8125
         protocol: "UDP"
       prefix: statsd.appmesh
    ```
    Please remember to provide the prefix to the agent monitor configuration.

    See [Envoy API reference](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.6.0/api-v2/config/metrics/v2/stats.proto#envoy-api-msg-config-metrics-v2-statsdsink) for more info

    Sample SignalFx SmartAgent configuration:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
     - type: appmesh
       listenAddress: 0.0.0.0
       listenPort: 8125
       metricPrefix: statsd.appmesh
    ```
