    (Windows Only) This monitor reports metrics about requests, errors, sessions,
    worker processes for ASP.NET applications.

    ## Windows Performance Counters
    The underlying source for these metrics are Windows Performance Counters.
    Most of the performance counters that we query in this monitor are actually Gauges
    that represent rates per second and percentages.

    This monitor reports the instantaneous values for these Windows Performance Counters.
    This means that in between a collection interval, spikes could occur on the
    Performance Counters.  The best way to mitigate this limitation is to increase
    the reporting interval on this monitor to collect more frequently.
