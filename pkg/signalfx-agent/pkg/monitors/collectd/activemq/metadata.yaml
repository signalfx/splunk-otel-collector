    SignalFx's integration with ActiveMQ wraps the [Collectd GenericJMX
    monitor](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/gdi/genericjmx/genericjmx.html)
    to monitor ActiveMQ.

    Use this monitor to gather the following types of information from ActiveMQ:

    * Broker (Totals per broker)
    * Queue (Queue status)
    * Topic (Topic status)

    To monitor the age of messages inside ActiveMQ queues, see [ActiveMQ
    message age listener](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/gdi/activemq/activemq.html)[](sfx_link:amq-message-age).

    <!--- SETUP --->
    ## Example config

    ```yaml
    monitors:
     - type: collectd/activemq
       host: localhost
       # This is the remote JMX port for ActiveMQ
       port: 1099
    ```
  metrics:
    # Taken from genericjmx monitor. If you want to change them update genericjmx and update
    # all other monitors that use genericjmx with this same notice.
