    Monitors a Kafka instance using collectd's
    GenericJMX plugin. See the [collectd/genericjmx
    monitor](./collectd-genericjmx.md)[](sfx_link:java) for more information on
    how to configure custom MBeans, as well as information on troubleshooting
    JMX setup.

    This monitor has a set of [built in MBeans
    configured](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/collectd/kafka/mbeans.go)
    for which it pulls metrics from Kafka's JMX endpoint.

    Note that this monitor supports Kafka v0.8.2.x and above. For Kafka v1.x.x and above,
    apart from the list of default metrics, kafka.server:type=ZooKeeperClientMetrics,name=ZooKeeperRequestLatencyMs
    is a good metric to monitor since it gives an understanding of how long brokers wait for
    requests to Zookeeper to be completed. Since Zookeeper is an integral part of a Kafka cluster,
    monitoring it using the [Zookeeper
    monitor](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/gdi/zookeeper/zookeeper.html)[](sfx_link:zookeeper)
    is recommended. It is also a good idea to monitor disk utilization and network metrics of
    the underlying host.

    # Taken from genericjmx monitor. If you want to change them update genericjmx and update
    # all other monitors that use genericjmx with this same notice.
