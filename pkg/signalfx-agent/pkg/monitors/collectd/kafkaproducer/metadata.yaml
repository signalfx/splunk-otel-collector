    Monitors a Java based Kafka producer using GenericJMX.

    This monitor has a set of [built in MBeans
    configured](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/collectd/kafkaproducer/mbeans.go)
    for which it pulls metrics from the Kafka producer's JMX endpoint.

    Sample YAML configuration:
    ```yaml
    monitors:
      - type: collectd/kafka_producer
        host: localhost
        port: 8099
    ```

    Note that this monitor requires Kafka v0.9.0.0 or above and collects metrics from the new producer API.
  metrics:
    # Taken from genericjmx monitor. If you want to change them update genericjmx and update
    # all other monitors that use genericjmx with this same notice.
