    Monitors a MySQL database server using collectd's [MySQL
    plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:MySQL). It supports
    MySQL versions 5.x or later.

    This monitor connects to a MySQL instance and reports on the values
    returned by a `SHOW STATUS` command. This includes the following:

      - Number of commands processed
      - Table and row operations (handlers)
      - State of the query cache
      - Status of MySQL threads
      - Network traffic

    <!--- SETUP --->
    ### Note on localhost
    On Unix, MySQL programs treat the host name `localhost` specially, in a way
    that is likely different from what is expected compared to other
    network-based programs. For connections to `localhost`, MySQL programs
    attempt to connect to the local server by using a Unix socket file. To ensure
    that the client makes a TCP/IP connection to the local server specify a host
    name value of `127.0.0.1`, or the IP address or name of the local server.

    <!--- SETUP --->
    ### Databases
    You have to specify each database you want to monitor individually under
    the `databases` config option.  If you have a common authentication to all
    databases being monitored, you can specify that in the top-level
    `username`/`password` options, otherwise they can be specified at the
    database level.

    <!--- SETUP --->
    ### InnoDB metrics
    If you want to enable InnoDB metrics (`innodbStats` to `true`), be sure that
    you granted to your user the `PROCESS` privilege.

    ### Example Config

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```
    monitors:
     - type: collectd/mysql
       host: 127.0.0.1
       port: 3306
       databases:
         - name: dbname
         - name: securedb
           username: admin
           password: s3cr3t
       username: dbuser
       password: passwd
    ```
