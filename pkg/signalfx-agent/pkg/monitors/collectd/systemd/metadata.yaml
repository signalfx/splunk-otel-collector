    This [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent) monitor collects metrics about the state of
    configured systemd services using the [collectd-systemd](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-systemd)
    plugin. A service is in the state that a metric represents if the metric value is 1 and not in that state if the
    metric value is 0. The name of the service that the metric is reporiting about is assigned to dimension
    `systemd_service`.

    The collectd-systemd plugin reads the status of systemd services from host location `/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket`.
    This means that the host location must be mounted to the container in which the SignalFx Smart Agent is running.
    The agent container must also run in privilege mode. Below is an excerpt of the docker run command.
    ```yaml
    docker run ...\
      --privileged \
      -v /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:ro \
    ...
    ```
    Below is a sample SignalFx Smart Agent YAML configuration for monitoring the state of `docker` and `ubuntu-fan`
    services. See [here](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent#configuration) for SignalFx Smart Agent
    configuration details.
    ```yaml
    monitors:
    - type: collectd/systemd
      intervalSeconds: 10
      services:
        - docker
        - ubuntu-fan
    ```
    Only the metric `gauge.substate.running`, which indicates whether a service is running or not, gets reported by default.
    The other metrics must be configure explicitly using the `sendActiveState`, `sendSubState` and `sendLoadState`
    configuration flags (see below). The metrics are grouped into `ActiveState`, `SubState` and `LoadState` groups.
    ```
    monitors:
    - type: collectd/systemd
      intervalSeconds: 10
      services:
        - docker
        - ubuntu-fan
      sendActiveState: true
    ```
