    Runs an HTTP server that listens for SignalFx datapoints and trace spans
    and forwards them to SignalFx (or the configured ingest host in the
    `writer` section of the agent config).  This supports the latest formats
    for datapoints (v2) and spans (v1) that our ingest server supports and at
    the same path (`/v2/datapoint`, `/v1/trace`).  By default, the server listens on
    localhost port 9080 but can be configured to anything.

    The `defaultSpanTagsFromEndpoint` and `extraSpanTagsFromEndpoint` config
    options are not compatible with the `signalfx-forwarder` monitor.
