monitors:
- dimensions:
  doc: |
    Emits metrics about the internal state of the
    agent.  Useful for debugging performance issues with the agent and to ensure
    the agent isn't overloaded.

    This can also scrape any HTTP endpoint that exposes metrics as a JSON array
    containing JSON-formatted SignalFx datapoint objects.  It is roughly
    analogous to the `prometheus-exporter` monitor except for SignalFx
    datapoints.

  metrics:
    sfxagent.active_monitors:
      description: The total number of monitor instances actively working
      default: true
      type: gauge
    sfxagent.active_observers:
      description: The number of observers configured and running
      default: true
      type: gauge
    sfxagent.configured_monitors:
      description: The total number of monitor configurations
      default: true
      type: gauge
    sfxagent.correlation_updates_invalid:
      description: The number of trace host correlation updates attempted against invalid dimensions
      default: true
      type: cumulative
    sfxagent.correlation_updates_client_errors:
      description: The number of HTTP status code 4xx responses received while updating
        trace host correlations
      default: true

    sfxagent.correlation_updates_retries:
      description: The total number of times a trace host correlation requests have been retried
      default: true
      type: cumulative
    sfxagent.datapoint_channel_len:
      description: The total number of datapoints that have been emitted by monitors
        but have yet to be accepted by the writer. This number should be 0 most of
        the time.  This will max out at 3000, at which point no datapoints will be
        generated by monitors.  If it does max out, it indicates a bug or extreme
        CPU starvation of the agent.
      default: true
      type: gauge
    sfxagent.datapoint_requests_active:
      description: The total number of outstanding requests to ingest currently active.  If
        this is consistently hovering around the `writer.maxRequests` setting, that
        setting should probably be increased to give the agent more bandwidth to send
        datapoints.
      default: true
      type: gauge
    sfxagent.datapoints_filtered:
      description: The total number of datapoints that were filtered out in the writer.  This
        does not include datapoints filtered by monitor-specific filters.
      default: true
      type: cumulative
    sfxagent.datapoints_in_flight:
      description: The total number of datapoints that have been sent out in a request
        to ingest but have yet to receive confirmation from ingest that they have
        been received (i.e. the HTTP response hasn't been gotten).
      default: true
      type: gauge
    sfxagent.datapoints_received:
      description: The total number of non-filtered datapoints received by the agent
        writer since it last started.  This number should generally equal `sfxagent.datapoints_sent
        + sfxagent.datapoints_waiting + sfxagent.datapoints_in_flight`, although sampling
        timing issues might cause it to temporarily not be.
      default: true

      description: The total number of datapoints sent by the agent writer since it
        last started

    sfxagent.datapoints_failed:
      description: |
        The total number of datapoints that tried to be sent but could not be
        by the agent writer since it last started.  This can be due to network
        failures or an incorrect access token, among other things.
      default: true
      type: cumulative
    sfxagent.datapoints_waiting:
      description: The total number of datapoints that have been accepted by the writer
        but have yet to be sent out to ingest over HTTP.  If this continues to grow
        it indicates that datapoints are not being sent out fast enough and the `writer.maxRequests`
        setting should be increased.
      default: true
      type: gauge
    sfxagent.dim_request_senders:

        updates.
