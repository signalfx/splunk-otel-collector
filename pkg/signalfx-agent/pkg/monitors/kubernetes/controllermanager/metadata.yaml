monitors:
- doc: |
    Exports Prometheus metrics from the [kube-controller-manager]
    (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/).
    The monitor queries path `/metrics` by default when no path is configured. The monitor converts
    the Prometheus metric types to SignalFx metric types as described [here](prometheus-exporter.md)

    An example configuration

    ```yaml
    monitors:
    - type: kube-controller-manager
      discoveryRule: kubernetes_pod_name =~ "kube-controller-manager" && target == "pod"
      port: 10252
      extraDimensions:
        metric_source: kube-controller-manager
    ```

    Note that all metrics of this monitor are non-default and will be emitted only
    if specified explicitly.
