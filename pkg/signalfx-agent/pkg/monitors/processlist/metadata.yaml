    This monitor reports the currently running processes for a host, analogous
    to how the `top` or `ps` command on Unix/Linux systems works.  The output
    format is a special base64-encoded event that gets processed by our backend
    and displayed under the Infrastructure view for a specific host.
    Historical process information is not retained on the backend, only the
    most recent version.
