    This is an embedded form of the [Telegraf Exec
    plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/exec).
    The plugin-specific config options are the same as that plugin, but parser
    config related to the format of the subprocess output (e.g. `data_format`)
    is managed via the `telegrafParser` nested config object.

    Here is an example of using the `influx` data format:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
     - type: telegraf/exec
       command: /usr/local/bin/my-script.sh
       telegrafParser:
         dataFormat: influx
    ```

    By default, all metrics are emitted as gauges.  If you have some cumulative
    counter metrics that you want properly typed in Signalfx, you have two
    options:

      - Set the config option `signalFxCumulativeCounters` to the list of
        metric names that should be considered counters. Note that these names
        are the full name as it will be sent to SignalFx (e.g.
        `<metric>.<field>`)

      - Set a tag called `signalfx_type` on the metric emitted by the exec
        script to `cumulative`.  All other values are ignored.  Note that you
        **must allow this tag value through in your parser configuration** if the
        parser ignores certain fields (e.g. the JSON parser requires adding
        `signalfx_type` to the `JSONTagKeys` config option).
