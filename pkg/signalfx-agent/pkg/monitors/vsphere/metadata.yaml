    doc: |
      A VMware vSphere deployment includes physical hosts, ESXi hypervisors, virtual machines, and a vCenter Server.
      
      To report metrics for a vSphere deployment, this monitor logs into a vCenter Server 
      and retrieves data about the deployment and its real-time performance data on a regular interval.

      When the monitor first runs, it logs into the vCenter Server and traverses the inventory, gathering and caching all of
      the hosts and virtual machines, and their available metrics.

      After this initial sweep, the monitor will query the vCenter for performance data and metrics. 
      This query takes place every 20 seconds, which is the interval at which the vCenter makes real-time performance data available.
      As a result, regardless of the `intervalSeconds` value in the agent config, this monitor will run every 20 seconds.
      
      The monitor also refreshes, at a configurable interval, the cache of hosts, virtual machines, and metrics. 
      By default, this refresh takes place every 60 seconds; however, this interval can be changed by updating the configuration field
      `InventoryRefreshInterval`.

      Compatibility:
      This monitor uses VMware's govmomi SDK, which officially supports vCenter 6.5, 6.7, and 7.0.
      While this monitor may work with vCenter 5.1, 5.5, and 6.0, these versions are not officially supported.
